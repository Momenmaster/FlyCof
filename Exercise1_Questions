Questions: 
1) What is the difference between git and github?
Git is a tool that allows you to keep track of changes you make to your code. 
It is a distributed version control system, allowing you to easily revert to a previous version if necessary.
GitHub is a website that provides a place for you to store your code online and collaborate with others. 
It's like a social network for developers, where you can share your code with others.

2) Name 3 benefits of a version control system
Collaboration with backup and recovery option
Controling different verisons,branching and merging and tracability
Continuous integration and deployment

3) Name 3 alternatives to git:
Mercurial, Perforce, Bitbucket

4) Name 2 differences between git and other version control systems:
Git is known for its speed and performance, which is a main factor in bigger software projects.
The second thing is there is a more flexible approach to branching and merging compared to other version control systems.

5) Name known issues related to game engines (Unreal, Unity) and version control systems:
Third-party plugins and dependencies: 
Game engines often rely on third-party plugins and dependencies, which can cause issues with version control if they are not managed properly. 

Large codebases: 
Game engine projects can be quite large and complex, with many different systems and subsystems interacting with each other. 
This can make it difficult to manage the codebase in a version control system, especially if the codebase is poorly organized or if there are few conventions or standards in place.

Binary file formats: 
Game engine projects often include binary files, which are files that are not human-readable and cannot be easily merged or diffed. 
This can make it difficult to track changes to these files in a version control system.
